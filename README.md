📄 PDF Data Extraction Using LLMs
This project implements a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for extracting and retrieving information from PDFs. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and FAISS for semantic search and vector embeddings, this project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for processing PDF documents, enabling advanced question-answering capabilities.

📂 Project Overview
PDF Data Extraction Using LLMs is designed to streamline document processing, providing a highly accurate solution for information retrieval from complex PDF documents. This tool includes:

Text Extraction & Preprocessing: Efficiently extracts text from PDFs, with support for chunking and cleaning.
Vector Embedding & Similarity Search: Uses FAISS and LLM-generated embeddings to build a robust vector store, enabling high-accuracy similarity search.
Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit, the UI supports file uploads and real-time query processing.
🚀 Features
Semantic Search: Employs vector embeddings and FAISS for optimized retrieval accuracy.
RAG Integration: Combines LLMs with FAISS for high-performance document search and question-answering.
Responsive UI: User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, enabling seamless file uploads and interactive querying.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries: FAISS, Streamlit, LangChain, and Large Language Models (Google GenAI)
Other Tools: Data extraction and visualization tools for PDF processing
